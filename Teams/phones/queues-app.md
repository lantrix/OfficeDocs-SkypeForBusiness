# Queues app on Teams phones

Queues app is a Microsoft Teams native solution designed to empower organizations to streamline their customer engagement. With the latest [release](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-devices-eabf4d81-acdd-4b23-afa1-9ee47bb7c5e2) update of Teams app version: 1449/1.0.94.2024122303 on Teams phones, the Queues app is now supported for Teams phones. In addition to Teams phones, Teams desktop, Mac, and Virtualized Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) clients are supported.

To set up and configure the Queues app for users in your organization, see [Manage Queues app for Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/manage-queues-app).

Using the Queues app on Teams phones lets users:

- They can view all call queues for authorized users can opt-in/opt-out all the call queues. 
- They can interact with your team members grouped by opt in/opt out status. To initiate a call, they can select a team member from the menu.
- They can place outgoing calls. In case when an organization has multiple outbound numbers to choose from, they can choose which number they want to use.
- They can view past calls, including any calls they missed. They can select any call from the call history to see more detailed information and call that number back using the number associated with the call queue. Currently, call history includes the past calls they answered or a call notification when they miss a call and a voicemail message is left.

> [!NOTE]
> Queues app on Teams phone devices doesn't support real-time analytics and historical reporting. To utilize those functionalities, use the Queues app on Teams desktop, Mac, and Virtualized Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) clients.
